Once an alien met me . His name was 'Jojo' . He lived on a planet no human has heard of . It was 'Timtim' . He had just a bunch of people living on his planet.
They had so much fun living there . There was no science there . Law of magic was everything. He came to Earth to experience Human life . He took me with him 
to see his planet . Oh my god ! it was amazing ! .
